# Exercise 4-1

Create an application with the following features:

1. Complete the tutorial application by doing the steps in "Start another activity" (link below).
2. Modify the app so that in the main activity instead of a message, it will ask the user for their name and age (x2 `EditText`) and in the display activity, it will show text "Hello XX, you are YY year old" (send XX and YY with values of name and age coming from the `EditText` fields in the main activity as extras to the display activity).

**NB!** Remember to define the `public static final String KEY` used as Intent extra key.
